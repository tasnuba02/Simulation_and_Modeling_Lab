Simulation & Modeling Lab
Assignments and exercises from the Simulation and Modeling Lab (CSE 413), focused on matrix operations, vector computations, and NumPy-based numerical analysis using Python. This repository contains my completed lab tasks for the Simulation and Modeling course (CSE 413) at Level 4, Term 1. The exercises cover scalar and array operations, matrix transformations, vector functions, and various mathematical computations using NumPy in Python. Bonus visualizations using Seaborn and random number generation are also included.
